# Limitations and Known Issues

While MultiMind provides powerful capabilities, there are some current limitations and areas for improvement:

## Testing and Debugging
- Limited testing across platforms (most testing done on Windows and Linux)
- Debugging capabilities are currently basic
- Error handling and reporting could be more robust

## Current Limitations
- Most LLM calls currently use the reasoning model option, which may not be optimal for all tasks

## Planned Enhancements
- Improved goal-based planning system
- More consistent context management across workflow steps
- Response streaming for better interactivity
- Clearer status tracking and progress indicators
- Expanded testing coverage across all platforms

We're actively working to address these limitations and improve the platform. Your feedback and bug reports are valuable in helping us prioritize improvements.
