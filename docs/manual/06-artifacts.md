# Working with Artifacts

Artifacts are the primary output of the platform, representing generated content and research results. This guide covers how to create, manage, and use artifacts effectively.

## Artifact Types

The platform supports several artifact types:

1. **Documents**
   - Research reports
   - Blog posts
   - Operational guides
   - Email drafts

2. **Data**
   - Research findings
   - Web scraping results
   - Structured data sets

3. **Media**
   - Images
   - Videos
   - Audio files

4. **Code**
   - Scripts
   - Configuration files
   - Templates

## Artifact Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Generated by agents during task execution
   - Created manually through the artifact editor
   - Imported from external sources

2. **Storage**
   - Stored in the vector database
   - Version controlled
   - Searchable by content and metadata

3. **Usage**
   - Attached to tasks and projects
   - Referenced in conversations
   - Used as input for other tasks

4. **Management**
   - Edit and update content
   - Add metadata and tags
   - Delete when no longer needed

## Creating Artifacts

### Automatic Creation
Artifacts are automatically created when:
- Research tasks complete
- Documents are generated
- Data is collected

Example:
```
[Research Agent] I've completed the research. Here's the report:
[Attached: Research Report - AI Trends 2025]
```

### Manual Creation
1. Open the Artifacts panel
2. Click the "+" button
3. Fill in the artifact details:
   - Type (document, data, media, code)
   - Title
   - Content
   - Metadata
4. Save the artifact

## Managing Artifacts

### Viewing Artifacts
- Browse through the Artifacts panel
- Search by title, content, or metadata
- Filter by type or project

### Editing Artifacts
1. Select an artifact
2. Click the edit button
3. Modify content or metadata
4. Save changes

### Deleting Artifacts
1. Select an artifact
2. Click the delete button
3. Confirm deletion

## Best Practices

1. **Organize with Metadata**
   - Add relevant tags
   - Include project and task references
   - Set expiration dates for temporary artifacts

2. **Version Control**
   - Create new versions instead of overwriting
   - Add version notes
   - Reference previous versions when needed

3. **Reuse Artifacts**
   - Reference existing artifacts in new tasks
   - Use templates for common document types
   - Share artifacts across projects

4. **Security**
   - Mark sensitive artifacts as private
   - Set appropriate access controls
   - Regularly review artifact permissions

## Example Workflow

1. Research task completes:
```
[Research Agent] Research complete. Created artifact: AI Trends Report
```

2. Review artifact:
- Open Artifacts panel
- Search for "AI Trends Report"
- Review content and metadata

3. Use artifact:
- Attach to project documentation
- Reference in conversations
- Use as input for content generation

4. Update artifact:
- Add new research findings
- Update metadata
- Create new version
