# TODO List

## 2024-12-16

- [ ] i think modelhelpers is augmenting every schema with artifactIds??
- [ ] fix where we store model output tokens, right now weâ€™re jamming a _usage on the actual responses, but we should make a new generate signature that can return these

## 2024-12-15

- [ ] added some very rough features like model response caches
- [ ] research manager is losing its steps when it kicks off children, it never moves on to aggregate.
- [ ] i'm not geting any research summaries saved, or webpage summaries.
- [ ] research assistants are not doing a multistep process, the plan only comes back with web-research (are they using single step planner?)

- [x] add to solver a code executor
- [ ] add a form capability for question generation to use in onboarding


## 2024-12-13

- [ ] need to finish transitioning project manager.
- [ ] the content manager is getting "stuck" when the sub project completes it doesnt seem to be able to push forward with more step-based processing
- [ ] implement dynamic RAG injection strategy like LM studio has based on content size
- [ ] i think the Bedrock processing is not using message history in the structured generation calls, i also found it wasnt even including system prompts
