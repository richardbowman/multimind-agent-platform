                - Their desired business outcomes
                - Their timeline and budget expectations

                AI Service Integration:
                - Which business processes they want to automate
                - What type of content or tasks they need help with
                - Their team's current workflow and pain points
                - Their experience level with AI tools
                - Their success metrics for AI automation
