# CSV Operations Guide

## Best Practices for Working with CSV Files

When processing CSV files, follow these steps to ensure successful operations:

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Always start by reading just the headers first
- Use the following code to extract headers:
```python
import csv

def get_headers(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        headers = next(reader)
    return headers
```

### 2. Handle BOM (Byte Order Mark)
- Always set `bom: true` when parsing CSV files
- Use UTF-8 encoding with BOM support:
```python
with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as f:
    # Process file
```

### 3. Data Validation
- Check for empty rows and columns
- Validate data types for each column
- Handle missing values appropriately

### 4. Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks for file operations
- Validate file existence before processing
- Handle encoding errors gracefully

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Use streaming for large files
- Process data in chunks when possible
- Monitor memory usage

### 6. Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to handle BOM characters
- Not checking for empty files
- Ignoring encoding issues
- Not validating column counts

### 7. Recommended Libraries
- Python: `csv`, `pandas`
- JavaScript: `csv-parser`, `papaparse`
- Java: `opencsv`, `Apache Commons CSV`

Remember to always test your CSV processing code with various file formats and edge cases.
