# Overview

## Description
Generate 100 marketing messages using a hierarchical and iterative approach. First develop themes, then generate messages for each theme.

## Steps

1. **Understand Goals**  
   Action Type: understand-goals  
   Confirm the marketing objectives, target audience, and key product features with the user.

2. **Theme Development**  
   Action Type: outline  
   Generate 5-7 core marketing themes that align with the goals.  
   Example themes:  
   - Product benefits  
   - Social proof  
   - Urgency/Scarcity  
   - Emotional appeal  
   - Problem/Solution  

3. **Message Generation**  
   Action Type: writing  
   For each theme:  
   a. Generate 15-20 message variations  
   b. Review for quality and consistency  
   c. Refine based on feedback  

4. **Final Review**  
   Action Type: editing  
   Review all messages for:  
   - Consistency with brand voice  
   - Clarity of message  
   - Grammar and style  
   - Diversity across themes  

## Roles

- **ContentManager**: Oversees the process, manages themes, and coordinates with ContentWriter
- **ContentWriter**: Handles the actual message generation and refinement

## Important Notes

1. Use a consistent prompt template for message generation:  
   "Generate [number] marketing messages for [theme] that [specific goal]. Target audience: [description]. Tone: [style]."

2. Maintain a tracking system to ensure:  
   - Balanced distribution across themes  
   - No duplicate messages  
   - Coverage of all key product features

3. If context limits are reached:  
   - Process themes sequentially  
   - Maintain theme summaries between batches  
   - Use vector storage for message tracking
