# Artifact Types and Supported Subtypes

This guide outlines the main artifact types and their supported subtypes in the system.

## Supported Artifact Types and Subtypes

The main artifact types and their supported subtypes are listed in [artifact-types.csv](artifact-types.csv).

## Document Subtypes

Specific document subtypes and their descriptions are listed in [document-subtypes.csv](document-subtypes.csv).

## Notes
- The system will attempt to process any file type, but may have limited functionality for unsupported formats
- Some file types may be supported across multiple main types (e.g., .md for both Document and Procedure Guide)
- New file types can be added to the system through configuration updates
